# 💍 Marriage Eligibility Checker

> *Because someone needed to automate the most basic math problem ever*

## 🤔 What is this?

This is a **REVOLUTIONARY** web application that answers humanity's most pressing question: 

*"Is 18 greater than the number I just typed?"*

Forget calculators. Forget common sense. We've got **GRADIENTS** and **ANIMATIONS** baby! 🎨✨

## 🎯 Purpose

The sole purpose of this masterpiece is to:
- ✅ Check if you're old enough to get married (18+)
- ✅ Help me learn JavaScript by writing the most beautiful 15 lines of code ever
- ✅ Flex some sick UI/UX design skills
- ✅ Make Bootstrap do the heavy lifting while I take all the credit

## 🚀 Features

- **Gradient backgrounds** that scream "I'm a professional developer"
- **Smooth animations** because static websites are for peasants
- **Circle indicators** that tell you YES or NO (revolutionary UX, I know)
- **Hover effects** that serve no functional purpose but look COOL
- **Your age input** gets judged faster than your life choices

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML (the boring one)
- CSS (where the magic happens ✨)
- JavaScript (my pride and joy - DO NOT TOUCH)
- Bootstrap (doing all the responsive work while I pretend I'm smart)

## 📱 Mobile Support

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING ⚠️

**Listen up, smartphone warriors:**

This website is *technically* responsive thanks to Bootstrap, which means it **WILL** work on your phone. 

**HOWEVER...**

If you're crazy enough to open a marriage eligibility checker on your phone instead of using a proper computer or laptop, you need to reevaluate your life choices. 

No media queries were written for mobile because:
1. I'm lazy 
2. You should be using a computer like a civilized human being
3. Bootstrap's doing all the work anyway
4. If you open this on mobile, you deserve whatever chaos awaits you

**Mobile users be warned:** The app works, but my disappointment in you is immeasurable. 📱😤

## 💻 How to Use

1. Open it on a **COMPUTER** (seriously)
2. Type your age
3. Click the button
4. Watch circles light up like it's Christmas
5. Congratulations, you now know if 18 is bigger than your number

## 🎓 What I Learned

- JavaScript event listeners (I'm basically a senior dev now)
- How to compare numbers (revolutionary stuff)
- That gradients make everything look professional
- Bootstrap is my best friend
- People who use phones for web development make questionable decisions

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to improve this? Sure! But remember:
- **DO NOT** touch my JavaScript. It's perfect.
- You can mess with HTML/CSS all you want
- Feel free to add more gradients (you can never have enough)
- If you add media queries for mobile... why? Just why?

## 📄 License

MIT License - Do whatever you want with this. Steal it. Improve it. Judge it. I don't care.

Just remember: This project was born from laziness, powered by Bootstrap, and maintained by someone who refuses to write media queries.

## 🎪 Final Words

This project exists because I wanted to learn JavaScript by building something. Is it practical? No. Is it necessary? Absolutely not. Does it have smooth animations and a gradient background? **YOU BET IT DOES.**

If this helped you in any way, cool. If you laughed at my code, also cool. If you opened this on mobile... I'm watching you. 👀

*P.S. - Yes, I know the variable names are basic. Yes, I know there are better ways to do this. But this is MY beautiful disaster and I'm proud of it.* 🎉
